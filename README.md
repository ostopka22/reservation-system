# reservation-system
Final Project for Software Engineering
-Purpose: To make an easier and simplified way to keep track of reservations for a restaurant 

For this specified system a menu was made with the following options: 
A. View all reservations 
B. Make reservation
C. Delete reservation
D. Change time of reservation
E. Change amount of people for a reservation 
F. Exit System 

This menu will loop to keep it consistent and easy to use as when using options C-E. Options C-E, will require you first to find the "number", found in option A, correlating to the reservation. 

-This system using the Python language it split into seperate files to keep it consistent and able to change code around if needed. 

-Reservations are stored within a text file and if a text file was never made it will be automatically automated.
